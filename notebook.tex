\subsubsection{Math 502 - Lamoureux}\label{math-502---lamoureux}

\subsubsection{Due January 31, 2019}\label{due-january-31-2019}

    \subsection{Exercise 0}\label{exercise-0}

Plot a few Bessel functions of the first kind, using your knowledge of
Python. Plot for orders \(\alpha = 0,1,2,3\) and choose a sensible range
of values for the domain.

(Hint: You might want to look back at our sample code on how we plotted
a sine or cosine function, and replicate that for a Bessel function. You
may have to look up on Google how to call a Bessel function from some
toolbox in Python.)

Please don't work too hard -\/- I don't want to see your approximate
solution as an infinite sum or integral form!! Use functions you can
call from Python and its modules.

    \subsection{Exercise 1}\label{exercise-1}

Recall in Lecture 4 (Jan 22), we had a model for the traffic jam model,
with a jump in the velocity function. Replace the jump function for
\(v(x)\) with a smooth, monotonic function that has a left limit of
\(v_{left}\) and a right limit of \(v_{right}\). Choose a function where
it is easy to calculate the antiderivative of slowness \(1/v(x)\).

Do calculate the function \(S(x)\) as the antiderivative of slowness
\(1/v(x)\), for your choice of \(v(x)\).

Hint: Rational functions won't work. (Exercise 1a. Why not?) You might
want to consider functions like arctan, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) or hyperbolic
tan, \(\tanh(x)\).

    \subsection{Exercise 2}\label{exercise-2}

Adjust the code in Lecture 4 to use your new definition of \(v(x)\) and
the resulting \(S(x).\) Show that it works by making a few illustrative
plots.

    \subsection{Exercise 3}\label{exercise-3}

Kepler's third law of planetary motion says that the length of time it
takes a planet to orbit the sun is proportional to its distance from the
sun, raised to some (fractional) power. That is: \[ T = k R^\alpha,\]
where \(T\) is the length of time for one complete orbit, \(R\) is the
distance between the planet and the sun, \(\alpha\) is a fixed power,
and \(k\) is some univeral constant that works for all the planets
around our sun.

Use Dimensional Analysis (Buckingham's Pi Theorem) to derive this
result. Tell me what the value of \(\alpha\) is.

Don't use calculus! (Although you may have seen this solved via
differential equations in a calc or physics class.)

Hint: There is some ambiguity because of two masses involved (sun and
planet). Newton knew that the mass of the planet does not matter to
\(T\), so you can assume this as well. Newton's universal gravitation
constant \(G\) also enters into the problem -\/- you can look up what
units it is measured in, on Google. Or you can figure it out yourself
from the force formula for planetary attraction
\[\mbox{ Force } = G \frac{Mm}{R^2}\] where \(M,m\) are the masses of
the sun and planet.

You can also check your answer by looking up Kepler's laws on Google.

    \subsection{Exercise 4}\label{exercise-4}

Make a table listing the 8 planets plus Pluto, their distance to the
sun, and the period of their orbit.

Make a log-log plot of period versus distance, and check that you get a
straight line with slope equal to \(\alpha\). (At least approximately.)

i.e. Taking logs of the equation \(T = kR^\alpha\) gives
\[\log T = \log k + \alpha \log R,\] which is the equation of a line in
\(x = \log R, y = \log T.\)

    \subsection{Exercise 5}\label{exercise-5}

Nuclear bombs, when exploded in the atmosphere, produce a large fireball
that expands in the approximate shape of a sphere of some radius
\(r = r(t)\), which is a function of elapsed time. The rate at which it
expands depends on the energy \(E\) released by the bomb, the elapsed
time \(t\) since the detonation, and the density \(\rho\) of the
surrounding air.

Curiously, the actual air pressure is irrelevant, as it is so small
compared to the explosive blast.

Use dimensional analysis to find \(r(t)\) as a function of \(E,t,\rho\).
(times some fixed constant)

    \subsection{Exercise 6 - for fun.}\label{exercise-6---for-fun.}

Can you animate the result in Exercise 5, showing some bomb blasts of
various energies? Something pretty?
