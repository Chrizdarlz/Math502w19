    "## Mathematical modeling\n",
    "Math modeling is a bit of an art. We want to create a representation of some process that is quantitative, and allows us to do some calculations that produce insight into process. Ideally, the model should be validated by comparing its results with observations of the real process, and indeed we would like to use the model to make predictions about the process that we have not yet observed (but would like to). \n",

    "I would suggest this is a good place to read up on the process of mathematical modeling. Different authors have difference ideas on how this is done, and you might find something out there that really resonates with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how A.C. Fowler breaks it down, in his book \"Mathematical Model in the Applied Sciences.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The procedure of modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Problem identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify a problem. Something we don't understand, a phenomena that needs an explanation. Try to identify a mechanism that explains the phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Model formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once identified, the mechanism should be formulated mathematically. Identify variable, and their dependences, and formulate as systems of equations (with boundary conditions, as well as evolution equations). Often we rely on physical laws (e.g. conservation of mass, of energy), empirical laws (e.g. friction), or hypothesized laws (e.g. rates of predation depends on the product of the number of predators time the number of prey). Simpler models are often more useful than complex models for understanding key phenomena -- more complex models can be created as needed. (We should think about well-posedness of the problem as we develop the model.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To get to a solution, it is sometimes important to remove unnecessary terms in the model. One way to approach this is to non-dimensionalize the problem, in order to discover which terms are unusually large or unusually small (relative to other terms). This leads to asymptotic methods that we hear so much about.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytic dissection is the process of breaking up a complicated model into various simpler components -- for instance, components that work at different time scales, or length scales. (For instance, in modeling ocean waves, you might distinguish between long, slow waves that travel large distances, and the smaller wavelets generated by gusts of wind.) Each individual component may represent a problem to be solved on its own, and then all the pieces brought together for a final model. In many cases, exact analytic solutions can be obtained for the component pieces, \n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical computation can be used to solve the original problem, the component pieces, or to link together the results of the analysis of the component pieces. All are options, and all have their use in various modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** Model validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical model must go back to the original problem, to see if the model and analysis explains the phenomena being studies. Do the computed data match the experimental data? Does predicted stability (or regions of stability) in the model match the observed stabiity of the process. Fowler make the point that the justification of the model is often that the various choices we made in developing the model are seen to work. "

It creeps along from a while, then the road clears and we rapidly go back to travelling at the speed limit. This is a weird phenomena -- there was nothing on the road to block the traffic, it just seemed to cluster up and slow down. \n",

    "For a simplified model, we do a continuous approximation. Imagine a straight length of road, with cars distributed on along the road.

We assume all the cars at some point are moving with roughly the same velocity, which we denote by $v = v(x,t)$, a function that varies with both position and time. The flux $q=q(x,t)$ is the number of cars per second that pass through the point $x$ on the roadway, which can vary with the time $t$.

    "Take a simple pendulum of length $L$, mass $m$, under gravity of magnitue $g$, and for small oscillations, we assume it has a period of time length $T$. Here we have $n=4$ physical parameters ($L,m,g,T$), and $r=3$ units of dimension (mass, time and length). So we expect $k=1$ dimensionless parameter to describe the problem. We could guess it, but lets use this matrix method. Here, we express the units of $T,m,L,g$ in terms of powers of the basic dimensions, so \n",
